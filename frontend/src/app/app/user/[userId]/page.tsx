/*
This is a given user's profile page.

Towards the top you should see the user's profile:
  - Profile image
  - Full name
  - Headline

Then the user page has two tabs.

Projects tab - a list of projects the user has worked on.
Each project has:
  - Title
  - Tagline (optional): a one-liner of the project
  - Description
  - Thumbnail image (optional)
  - Github URL (optional)
  - Devpost URL (optional)
  - Started at time: this is when the project was actually started (created_at is just when the DB record got created)

Posts tab - a list of posts made by the user.
This is just like the feed page, but only shows posts made by the user.

Actions that can be performed on the user:
  - Follow user (you cannot follow yourself)
  - Mark as cracked
  - If you are the user, create a post
